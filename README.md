# Mood Voyage: Empowering Emotional Intelligence through Nonviolent Communication (NVC)

Understanding the "why" behind our feelings often gets lost in the daily shuffle, making meaningful introspection challenging. Mood Voyage aims to quantify emotional needs in an elegant and approachable way through scientifically backed principles of Nonviolent Communication (NVC). 

## What is Nonviolent Communication (NVC)?

NVC is a communication approach developed by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg in the 1960s. It's based on the idea that all human beings have the capacity for compassion and that our natural state is one of empathy and cooperation. 

The NVC process involves four key components:

1. Observation: Objectively describing what is happening without judgment or evaluation.
2. Feelings: Identifying and expressing the emotions that arise in response to the observation.
3. Needs: Recognizing the underlying needs, values, or desires connected to the feelings.
4. Requests: Making clear, specific, and actionable requests to help meet the identified needs.

## Scientific Basis

Research has shown that NVC can:
- Improve empathy and understanding in communication (Marlow et al., 2012)
- Reduce stress and increase well-being (Wacker & Dziobek, 2018)
- Enhance relationship satisfaction and conflict resolution skills (Nosek et al., 2014)
